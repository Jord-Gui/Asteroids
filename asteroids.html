        <h1>Asteroids</h1>
        <div style="width:600px">
            <h5>Premise:</h5>
            <p style="font-size:12px;">
                The horrendous war between the evil galatic empire and your crew of misfits has resulted in 
                your ship being severely damaged. Just as you are retreating back to an outpost to repair the ship, 
                the mystical warlord general Mit traps you in his pocket dimension and unleashes waves of asteroids
                in an attempt to destroy you. 
            </p>
            <h5>Rules:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li style="font-size:12px">
                    You must survive 3 waves of asteroids, with each wave having more asteroids than the next. A big asteroid 
                    will break down into two smaller ones whe shot. When a smaller asteroid is shot by a laser it will be 
                    destroyed
                </li>
                <li style="font-size:12px">
                    Your ship has been severely damaged, and to conserve power, shields have been reduced to only activate
                    when hit by an object. When the shield does activate, it can only last a certain amount of of time up to
                    a maximum of 3 seconds. When the ship is yellow, it means shields are active. The initial shield at the start
                    of the game will only last 3 seconds to prepare you for the battle
                </li>
                <li style="font-size:12px">
                    The auto-aim on the ship's laser has been damaged, and so the ship must come to a complete stop before
                    it is able to shoot off a laser
                </li>
                <li style="font-size:12px">
                    The ship can only take up to 3 hits before it is fully destroyed
                </li>
                <li style="font-size:12px">
                    The pocket dimension wraps around the edges so you cannot escape until you destroy all the asteroids!
                </li>
            </ul>
